# Hi there! I'm Gamaliel

I'm a web developer, passionate about building products that are useful and easy to use. Python is my favorite programming language and Django has been my main framework for the last two years, but I'm always looking for new technologies and practices to learn and improve my skills. I'm also a big fan of everything related to Linux and open source software.

Here you can find some of my projects, you can find more about them clicking on the links below.

My contact information and CV can be found at the bottom of this page.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
