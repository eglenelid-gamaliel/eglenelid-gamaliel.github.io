In conjunction with the appointments web app, this Django application allows the company's employees to view the status of their appointments, mark them as attended, and request authorizations to a higher-level manager for certain types of actions. The manager can then approve or deny the request and to do so, has to be logged in and input a one-time token that is generated by the app and sent to their email.

The tokens are generated using the "secrets" python module then are hashed, salted and stored in the database.

The administrators can also view key performance indicators for the company's employees, such as the number of appointments, the number of appointments that have been attended, and the number of appointments that have been requested.

The backend is written in Python using the Django framework. The frontend is written in jQuery and Bootstrap.
